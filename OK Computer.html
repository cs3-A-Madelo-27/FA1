				<ul>
					<li>OK Computer is the third studio album by Radiohead.</li>
					<li>Released in the UK on 16 June 1997 by EMI.</li>
					<li>The album's lyrics depict a world fraught with rampant consumerism, social alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise; in this capacity, OK Computer is said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life.</li>
					<li> The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London.</li>
